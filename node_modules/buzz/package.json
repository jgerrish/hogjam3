It tries to degrade properly on non-modern browsers.\n\n    var mySound = new buzz.sound( \"/sounds/myfile\", {\n        formats: [ \"ogg\", \"mp3\", \"aac\" ]\n    });\n\n    mySound.play()\n        .fadeIn()\n        .loop()\n        .bind( \"timeupdate\", function() {\n            var timer = buzz.toTimer( this.getTime() );\n            document.getElementById( \"timer\" ).innerHTML = timer;\n        });\n\n### Official website\nhttp://buzz.jaysalvat.com/\n\n### Real life demo\nhttp://buzz.jaysalvat.com/demo/\n\n### Documentation\nhttp://buzz.jaysalvat.com/documentation/\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease don't edit files in the `dist` subdirectory as it is generated via Grunt.
